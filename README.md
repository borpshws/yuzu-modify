# yuzu-patcher
Use yuzu emulator without a Nintendo Switch!

## Instructions
Brief, make sure you have yuzu installed and run the script. The script should automatically proceed through it's steps and create the file required for the emulator to run.

## Obfuscation
The code from this script has been obfuscated with pyarmor and py2exe. The reason behind this is to hide the server this distributes the keys and hide the method used.

## Legality
As long as you own a Nintendo Switch and the own copies of the games you intend to use on the emulator, using this patching tool is 100% safe and legal. If you are unsure of the legality of your actions, I advice against usage
